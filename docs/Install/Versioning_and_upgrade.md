# <a name="GUID-2E350669-7E5A-47BC-AB15-58AC4CFAD9C1"/> Upgrading from earlier evaluation version
The current HPE Swarm Learning release is not compatible with the Eval or community 0.3.0 release. **You must** uninstall the 0.3.0 release before installing the current HPE Swarm Learning version. See [Uninstalling Swarm Learning](Uninstalling_the_Swarm_Learning_package.md).

To upgrade to the latest version, see [Install HPE Swarm Learning](Install_HPE_Swarm_Learning.md).
<br>The installer deletes existing Swarm Learning files and directories (`docs`, `examples`, `lib`, and `scripts`) from the location and copies updated Swarm Learning files and directories.
<br>Any directory or file created by users outside of the Swarm Learning directories is preserved during the upgrade process.
